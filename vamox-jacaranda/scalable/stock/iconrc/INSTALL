How to use stock icons?

You must copy the file iconrc included with Dropline Etiquette iconset to
	
	/usr/share/themes/<yourtheme>/gtk-2.0
	
or

	/home/<you>/.themes/<yourtheme>/gtk-2.0

and then edit the gtkrc file from <yourtheme> to make sure it's pointing
to the iconrc you want. the gtkrc file is usually located in the same directory 
as the iconrc (read a few lines above). in the gtkrc file make sure that the
following line is present:

	include "iconrc"
	
if you don't want to replace you'r old iconrc file then you can open the gtkrc
file and edit so it points to Dropline Etiquette's iconrc file:

	include "/path/to/dlg-etiquette/scalable/stock/iconrc/iconrc"
	
thanks for using this iconset!
